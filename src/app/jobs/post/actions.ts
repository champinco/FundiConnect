// This file's content (postJobAction) has been moved to src/app/jobs/actions.ts
// for better organization. This file can be deleted or kept empty if other specific
// 'post' related actions are added later. For now, it's empty to avoid duplication.

// If you need to re-export, you could do:
// export { postJobAction } from '../actions';

// However, it's cleaner if components directly import from '../actions' if that's where postJobAction now resides.
// For simplicity, I'll leave this file empty, assuming components will update their imports.
// If the build system or conventions require an export from this specific path,
// then the re-export approach would be necessary.

// For now, consider this file deprecated for postJobAction.
// The action is now in src/app/jobs/actions.ts

export {}; // Add an empty export to make it a module if needed
