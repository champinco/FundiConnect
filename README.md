## How to Fix "Cannot find module" Errors (e.g., './548.js')

If your application fails to start and you see an error like `Error: Cannot find module './548.js'`, it means your build cache is out of sync. This is a common issue with Next.js development and is **not a bug in the application source code itself**.

**To fix this, you must perform a clean rebuild from your terminal.** This process deletes the temporary build files and creates fresh ones.

Here are the steps:

1.  **Stop the server** (if it's running).

2.  **Delete the `.next` folder**:
    ```bash
    rm -rf .next
    ```
    *(On Windows, use `rd /s /q .next` in Command Prompt or `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next` in PowerShell).*

3.  **Rebuild the app**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    *Check the output of this command for any new errors. If the build itself fails, address those first.*

4.  **Start the app again**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Following these steps should resolve the "Cannot find module" error.
