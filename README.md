## Troubleshooting Build Issues

If you encounter errors like "Cannot find module" after building or starting the application, try the following steps:
1. Stop the Next.js server.
2. Delete the `.next` directory from your project root: `rm -rf .next`
3. Rebuild the application: `npm run build`
4. Start the server: `npm start`
